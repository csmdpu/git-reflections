When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To share code. Or to work on a project from multiple computers.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When
would you use one instead of another?

Forks are for creating my own version, separate from another person.
Branches I use for myself or when I'm working iwht other people. I use
a clone when I want to start from the beginning, when I haven't done
any work yet on a particular computer.
