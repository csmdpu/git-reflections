What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The command creates a .git directory, which keeps track of the status
and versions.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows us to control which files are committed.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can run git diff and git diff --staged to see if I have selected just the right files for the commit.
